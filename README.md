Guess the Number
A simple browser game where you have three chances to guess a number between 0 and 99.

How to Play
Open index.html in any browser.

Enter your guess (only digits, max 2 characters).

Click Check.

After each wrong guess, you'll see how many chances remain and get a hint.

If you guess correctly, you win! If you use all three chances, the game reveals the number and restarts.

Features
Input validation (no letters, max 2 digits)

Three attempts

Dynamic hints after first wrong guess

Automatic restart after win/loss

cd guess-the-number
# open index.html in your browser
Known Issue
